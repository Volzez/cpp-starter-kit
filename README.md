# 🚀 CPP-CODE: C++ Basics & Mini-Games

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This repository is a collection of **comprehensive tutorial notes**, **coding exercises**, and **interactive games** I've built while mastering the language. 👨‍💻✨

## 📂 What's Inside?

### 📚 Tutorial Series (Notes + Examples)
These files are structured as "living notebooks" with deep-dive comments and multiple code snippets in one place:

*   **`hello_world.cpp` (The Foundations) 🏗️**
    *   📥 **I/O Mastery:** `cout`, `cin`, and `getline`.
    *   🔢 **Variables:** Constants, type casting, and namespaces.
    *   🔄 **Logic:** `if/else`, `switch` cases, and the ternary operator.
    *   ➰ **Loops:** `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops with `break`/`continue`.
    *   🧵 **Strings:** A full reference of useful string methods.
    *   🎲 **Randomness:** Generating random numbers for games.

*   **`tut_part_2.cpp` (Intermediate & OOP) 🧠**
    *   🛠️ **Functions:** Prototypes, parameters, and passing by reference.
    *   📊 **Data Structures:** 1D & 2D Arrays, `sizeof` calculations, and for-each loops.
    *   📍 **Memory:** Pointers, addresses, `nullptr`, and Dynamic Memory (`new`/`delete`).
    *   ♻️ **Recursion:** Solving complex problems with self-calling functions.
    *   🏗️ **OOP (Object Oriented Programming):** Classes, Objects, Overloaded Constructors, Getters/Setters, and Inheritance.

### 🎮 Games & Projects
Ready-to-play console games built to practice logic and flow:

*   **🪨 📄 ✂️ Rock Paper Scissors:** A classic battle against the computer.
*   **❌ ⭕ Tic Tac Toe:** The ultimate 2-player strategy game.
*   **❓ Quiz Game:** Test your knowledge with multiple-choice questions.
*   **💰 Banking System:** A functional menu-driven app for deposits and withdrawals.
*   **🔢 Guessing Game:** Can you find the secret number?

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

If you have a C++ compiler (like `g++`) installed, you can run any file using your terminal:

1.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o output_name
    ```
2.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    ./output_name
    ```

## 📝 Personal Notes
*   This repo is focused on **learning**, so you'll find many different examples within the same file, often commented out for easy testing. 🧪
*   I use a `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean from binary executables and temp files. 🧹

**Happy Coding!** 💻🔥
